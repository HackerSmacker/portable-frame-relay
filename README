"async frame relay emulation"

This is a partial implementation of IETF Frame Relay that is intended to run over asynchronous serial interfaces. For frame relay over synchronous
(i.e. 8 megabit) V.35 serial, you will need to implement a synchronous serial controller that exposes to the host machine running this program as a
serial port. 

This supports:
- Linux, with either the new or old (pre-kernel 2.4) tun/tap device
- FreeBSD and NetBSD
- OS X (without any third-party kexts)

To use this, you must first set the baud rate of your serial port:
# stty -F /dev/tty00 115200

You can then use the program:
# ./async_frame_relay /dev/tty00 301 dte mylink.pcap
                      AAAAAAAAAA BBB CCC DDDDDDDDDDD
A = serial device
B = DLCI, which must be the same on both sides
C = dte, dce, or nni (one side must be the inverse of the other; use nni for no distinction)
D = packet capture file, this is a normal libpcap file

Once that's done, you can configure the resultant interface that gets created:
# ifconfig tun0 198.18.50.2 198.18.50.1
                AAAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBBBB
A = my IP
B = peer's IP
Linux users will use this instead:
# ifconfig tun0 198.18.50.2 dstaddr 198.18.50.1

Be sure to set the MTU to 1500 if it isn't already the default:
# ifconfig tun0 mtu 1500

If you wish to use IPv6:
# ifconfig tun0 500::1 500::2
